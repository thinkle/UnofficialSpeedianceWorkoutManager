## 📦 Installation

### Windows (Recommended)
1.  Download **`UnofficialSpeedianceWorkoutManager.exe`** from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/hbui3/UnofficialSpeedianceWorkoutManager/releases).
2.  Double-click the `.exe` file to run it.
    *   *Note: Windows Defender might warn you because this app is not signed. Click "More Info" -> "Run Anyway".*
3.  A control window will appear, and your default web browser will automatically open to the application.
4.  **Do not close the control window** while using the app. To stop the server, click "Stop Server & Exit" in the control window.

### macOS
1.  Download **`UnofficialSpeedianceWorkoutManager_Mac.zip`** from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/hbui3/UnofficialSpeedianceWorkoutManager/releases).
2.  Unzip the file.
3.  **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `UnofficialSpeedianceWorkoutManager_Mac` file and select **Open**.
    *   *Note: You must do this the first time to bypass the "Unidentified Developer" warning.*
4.  A terminal window will open (showing the server logs), and your browser will launch automatically.

### Running from Source (Developers)
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`.
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
5.  Open your browser at `http://localhost:8989`.

## Configuration

1.  Go to **Settings** and log in with your Speediance account credentials.
    *   **Region Selection**: Ensure you select the correct region (Global/EU/CN) where your account was created. Accounts are region-specific, and logging into the wrong region will fail.
2.  **Unit System**: You can switch between Metric (KG) and Imperial (LBS) in the Settings page. This will adjust the Workout Builder limits and display units accordingly.

## Security & Privacy

Your privacy and security are paramount.
- **Direct Connection**: All communication happens directly between your computer and the official Speediance servers. There are no intermediate servers or third-party data collection.
- **Credential Safety**: Your email and password are **never stored**. They are used once to obtain a secure session token from Speediance, which is then saved locally on your machine (`config.json`) to keep you logged in.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Authentication
Before you can manage workouts, you need to authenticate:
1. Navigate to the **Settings** page.
2. Enter your Speediance account email and password.
3. Click **Login**. Your session token will be saved locally to `config.json`.

### 2. Browsing Exercises
1. Click on **Library** in the navigation bar.
2. Use the search bar or muscle group filters to find exercises.
3. Click on any exercise to view details, videos, and instructions.

### 3. Creating a Custom Workout
1. Click on **Create Plan**.
2. **Add Exercises**: Click on exercises in the library sidebar (left) to add them to your plan (right).
3. **Configure Sets**:
   - Adjust sets, reps, weight, and rest times.
   - Select "Standard", "Chains", or "Eccentric" modes.
   - Choose presets (e.g., "Gain Muscle", "Strength") to auto-fill recommended ranges.
4. **Save**: Enter a name and click **Save**. The workout will sync to your Speediance device.

### 4. Scheduling Workouts
Manage your training schedule directly from the dashboard:
1. **Add to Calendar**: Drag any workout from your "My Workouts" list and drop it onto a date in the calendar.
2. **Reschedule**: Drag an already scheduled workout from one date to another to move it.
3. **Remove**: Click the **×** icon on a calendar entry to remove it.
   - *Note: Official Speediance Programs (shown in blue) are managed by the system and cannot be moved or deleted here.*
4. **Past Dates**: The system prevents scheduling or moving workouts to dates in the past.

### 5. Advanced AI Features (Import/Export)
Use the power of LLMs to design workouts:
1. Expand the **More Features (AI & Import/Export)** section in the Workout Builder.
2. Click **Generate Prompt**.
3. Describe your goal (e.g., "45 min chest and triceps hypertrophy").
4. Click **Generate Full Prompt** and copy the result.
5. Paste this prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or another LLM.
6. Copy the JSON response from the LLM.
7. Click **Import JSON** in the Speediance Desktop app and paste the code.
8. The workout will be automatically built with the correct exercises and settings.

**Pro Tip:** You can also use **Export JSON** to save your current workout to a file or share it with an AI to ask for adjustments (e.g., "Make this workout harder" or "Swap bench press for pushups").

#### Customizing AI Behavior
You can define global rules for the AI (e.g., "Always use metric units", "Prefer dumbbells over cables", "Include 2 min rest").
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Expand **Advanced: Manual Configuration**.
3. Enter your preferences in the **Custom AI Instructions** field.
4. Click **Save Manual Config**.
These instructions will be automatically appended to every prompt you generate.

### 5. Debugging Tools
If you encounter issues (like empty libraries or connection errors):
1. Look for the **Floating Code Button (</>)** in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
2. Click it to view the **Last API Response**.
3. This will show the raw data returned by the server, which is helpful for troubleshooting session issues or reporting bugs.

### 6. Offline Mode
To speed up the interface:
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Click **Download All Assets**.
3. This downloads all exercise media to `static/media_cache`.

## Testing

The project includes an End-to-End (E2E) test script to verify core functionality.

To run the tests:
```bash
python test_e2e_workouts.py
```
This script simulates a user logging in, creating a workout, and verifying the data structure.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Regional Differences
- The API endpoints used are based on the global/US servers. Users in China or other specific regions might use different API endpoints which are not currently supported.
